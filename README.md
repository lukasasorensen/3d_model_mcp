# 3d_model_mcp

Local-first conversational CAD using React, MCP tools, and OpenSCAD.

## Workspace

This repository is a pnpm workspace targeting Node.js 22 or newer. The package
boundaries intentionally separate browser-safe contracts from Node-only model,
renderer, MCP, gateway, and runtime concerns.

```text
apps/site              React/Next.js application shell
packages/contracts     browser-safe shared contracts
packages/model-project project and revision domain boundary
packages/renderer      legacy bounded STL/3MF codecs
packages/mcp           transport-neutral MCP boundary
packages/gateway       chat and provider orchestration boundary
packages/runtime       local combined-process boundary
```

OpenSCAD runs in the browser as a pinned WebAssembly module. A fresh Web Worker mounts the
pinned BOSL2 source bundle, renders with the Manifold backend, and is terminated after each
job. The server stores canonical OpenSCAD source and revision history only; generated STL
previews and 3MF downloads remain in the browser.

Install and verify the workspace:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
```

Detailed setup and the frozen R1→R2→R3→3MF script are in
[`docs/demo-script.md`](docs/demo-script.md). Architecture and trust boundaries are
documented in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and
[`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md). Dependency/license status is tracked in
[`docs/dependencies-and-licenses.md`](docs/dependencies-and-licenses.md).

## Chat orchestration

`POST /v1/chat` accepts the strict browser-safe v3 request contract and returns
newline-delimited v3 events. The route requires an exact `Origin` match and a
matching `x-rjls-session-id`, caps the streamed request body at 32 KiB, and
propagates disconnect cancellation through LangChain, the official MCP client,
and the renderer.

The credential-free default is `RJLS_CHAT_PROVIDER=mock`. It is deterministic
and supports the canonical blank bracket, 100 mm width edit, gusset edit, and
3MF export prompts for local demos and tests. No live-provider adapter or
default model is selected; that remains behind the provider evaluation gate.
The chat route pauses candidate validation until the originating browser reports the result
of rendering the exact candidate source hash. Invalid code never replaces the current revision.

## Release status

The deterministic integration harness proves the server workflow with an explicit test-only
renderer fixture. Browser OpenSCAD/BOSL2 smoke evidence, browser screenshots
and heap traces, live-provider evaluation/default selection, public deployment, and
the repository license/third-party notice decision remain blocked or deferred. See
[`docs/g006-verification-evidence.json`](docs/g006-verification-evidence.json). A2A
is a future research item and is not implemented.
